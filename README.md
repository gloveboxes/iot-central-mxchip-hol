# Connecting an MXChip IoT DevKit device to your Azure IoT Central application

![](/media/mxchip.png)

This article describes how, as a device developer, to connect a MXChip IoT DevKit (DevKit) device to your Microsoft Azure IoT Central application.

## Sample Devkits application

An application created from the **Sample Devkits** application template includes a **MXChip** device template that defines the following device characteristics:

- Telemetry measurements for **Humidity**, **Temperature**, **Pressure**, **Magnetometer** (measured along X, Y, Z axis), **Accelerometer** (measured along X, Y, Z axis), and **Gyroscope** (measured along X, Y, Z axis).
- State measurement for **Device State**.
- Event measurement for **Button B Pressed**.
- Settings for **Voltage**, **Current**, **Fan Speed**, and an **IR** toggle.
- Device properties **die number** and **Device Location**, which is a location property.
- Cloud property **Manufactured In**.
- Commands **Echo** and **Countdown**. When a real device receives an **Echo** command, it shows the sent value on the device's display. When a real device receives a **Countdown** command, the LED cycles through a pattern, and the device sends countdown values back to IoT Central.

For full details about the configuration, see [MXChip Device template details](#mxchip-device-template-details)

## Add a real device

### Get your device connection details

In your Azure IoT Central application, add a real device from the **MXChip** device template and make a note of the device connection details: **Scope ID, Device ID, and Primary key**:

1. Add a **real device** from Devices, select **+New > Real** to add a real device.

    - Enter a lowercase **Device ID**, or use the suggested **Device ID**.
    - Enter a **Device Name**, or use the suggested name

    ![Add Device](/media/howto-connect-devkit/add-device.png)

2. To get the device connection details, **Scope ID**, **Device ID**, and **Primary key**, select **Connect** on the device page.

    ![Connection details](/media/howto-connect-devkit/device-connect.png)

3. Make a note of the connection details. You're temporarily disconnected from the internet when you prepare your DevKit device in the next step.

### Prepare the DevKit device

If you've previously used the device and want to reconfigure it to use a different WiFi network, connection string, or telemetry measurement, press both the **A** and **B** buttons at the same time. If it doesn't work, press **Reset** button and try again.

#### To prepare the DevKit device

1. Download the v2.1.0 release of the pre-built Azure IoT Central firmware for the MXChip from the [releases](https://github.com/Azure/iot-central-firmware/releases/tag/mxchip-v2.1.0) page on GitHub.
1. Connect the DevKit device to your development machine using a USB cable. In Windows, a file explorer window opens on a drive mapped to the storage on the DevKit device. For example, the drive might be called **AZ3166 (D:)**.
1. Drag the **iotCentral.bin** file onto the drive window. When the copying is complete, the device reboots with the new firmware.

1. When the DevKit device restarts, the following screen displays:

    ```sh
    Connect HotSpot:
    AZ3166_??????
    go-> 192.168.0.1
    PIN CODE xxxxx
    ```

    > If the screen displays anything else, reset the device and press the **A**  and **B** buttons on the device at the same time to reboot the device.

1. The device is now in access point (AP) mode. You can connect to this WiFi access point from your computer or mobile device.

1. On your computer, phone, or tablet connect to the WiFi network name shown on the screen of the device. When you connect to this network, you don't have internet access. This state is expected, and you're only connected to this network for a short time while you configure the device.

1. Open your web browser and navigate to [http://192.168.0.1/start](http://192.168.0.1/start). The following web page displays:

    ![Device configuration page](/media/howto-connect-devkit/configpage.png)

    On the web page, enter:
    - The name of your WiFi network
    - Your WiFi network password
    - The PIN code shown on the device's display
    - The connection details **Scope ID**, **Device ID**, and **Primary key** of your device (you should have already saved this following the steps)
    - Select all the available telemetry measurements

1. After you choose **Configure Device**, you see this page:

    ![Device configured](/media/howto-connect-devkit/deviceconfigured.png)

1. Press the **Reset** button on your device.

## View the telemetry

When the DevKit device restarts, the screen on the device shows:

- The number of telemetry messages sent.
- The number of failures.
- The number of desired properties received and the number of reported properties sent.

> If the device appears to loop when it tries to connect, check if the device is **Blocked** in IoT Central, and **Unblock** the device so it can connect to the app.

Shake the device to send a reported property. The device sends a random number as the **Die number** device property.

You can view the telemetry measurements and reported property values, and configure settings in Azure IoT Central:

1. Use **Devices** to navigate to the **Measurements** page for the real MXChip device you added:

    ![Navigate to real device](/media/howto-connect-devkit/realdevicenew.png)

2. On the **Measurements** page, you can see the telemetry coming from the MXChip device:

    ![View telemetry from real device](/media/howto-connect-devkit/devicetelemetrynew.png)

3. On the **Properties** page, you can view the last die number and the device location reported by the device:

    ![View device properties](/media/howto-connect-devkit/devicepropertynew.png)

4. On the **Settings** page, you can update the settings on the MXChip device:

    ![View device settings](/media/howto-connect-devkit/devicesettingsnew.png)

5. On the **Commands** page, you can call the **Echo** and **Countdown** commands:

    ![Call commands](/media/howto-connect-devkit/devicecommands.png)

6. On the **Dashboard** page, you can see the location map

    ![View device dashboard](/media/howto-connect-devkit/devicedashboardnew.png)

## MXChip Development with Visual Studio Code (Advanced)

![MX Chip development with Visual Studio Code](/media/vs-code.png)

If you want to explore and modify the device code, you can download it from GitHub. If you plan to modify the code, you should follow these instructions to [prepare the development environment](https://microsoft.github.io/azure-iot-developer-kit/docs/get-started/#step-5-prepare-the-development-environment) for your desktop operating system.

To download the source code, run the following command on your desktop machine:

```cmd/sh
git clone https://github.com/Azure/iot-central-firmware
```

The previous command downloads the source code to a folder called `iot-central-firmware`.

> If **git** is not installed in your development environment, you can download it from [https://git-scm.com/download](https://git-scm.com/download).

## Review the code

Use Visual Studio Code to open the `MXCHIP/mxchip_advanced` folder in the `iot-central-firmware` folder:

![Visual Studio Code](/media/howto-connect-devkit/vscodeview.png)

To see how the telemetry is sent to the Azure IoT Central application, open the **telemetry.cpp** file in the `src` folder:

- The function `TelemetryController::buildTelemetryPayload` creates the JSON telemetry payload using data from the sensors on the device.

- The function `TelemetryController::sendTelemetryPayload` calls `sendTelemetry` in the **AzureIOTClient.cpp** to send the JSON payload to the IoT Hub your Azure IoT Central application uses.

To see how property values are reported to the Azure IoT Central application, open the **telemetry.cpp** file in the `src` folder:

- The function `TelemetryController::loop` sends the **location** reported property approximately every 30 seconds. It uses the `sendReportedProperty` function in the **AzureIOTClient.cpp** source file.

- The function `TelemetryController::loop` sends the **dieNumber** reported property when the device accelerometer detects a double tap. It uses the `sendReportedProperty` function in the **AzureIOTClient.cpp** source file.

To see how the device responds to commands called from the IoT Central application, open the **registeredMethodHandlers.cpp** file in the `src` folder:

- The **dmEcho** function is the handler for the **echo** command. It shows the **displayedValue** filed in the payload on the device's screen.

- The **dmCountdown** function is the handler for the **countdown** command. It changes the color of the device's LED and uses a reported property to send the countdown value back to the IoT Central application. The reported property has the same name as the command. The function uses the `sendReportedProperty` function in the **AzureIOTClient.cpp** source file.

The code in the **AzureIOTClient.cpp** source file uses functions from the [Microsoft Azure IoT SDKs and libraries for C](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c) to interact with IoT Hub.

For information about how to modify, build, and upload the sample code to your device, see the **readme.md** file in the `MXCHIP/mxchip_advanced` folder.

# Setting up a device template

A device template is a blueprint that defines the characteristics and behaviors of a type of device that connects to an Azure IoT Central application.

For example, a builder can create a device template for an IoT-connected fan that has a:

- Temperature telemetry measurement

- Fan motor error event measurement

- Fan operating state measurement

- Fan speed setting

- Location property

- Rules that send alerts

- Dashboard that gives you an overall view of the device

From this device template, an operator can create and connect real fan devices with names such as **fan-1** and **fan-2**. All these fans have measurements, settings, properties, rules, and a dashboard that users of your application can monitor and manage.


> Only builders and administrators can create, edit, and delete device templates. Any user can create devices on the **Devices** page from existing device templates.

## Create a device template

1. Navigate to the **Device Templates** page.

2. To create a template, start by selecting **+New**.

3. To get started quickly, choose from the existing pre-built templates. Otherwise, select **Custom**, enter a name, and click **Create** to build your own template from scratch.

   ![Device template library](/media/howto-set-up-template/newtemplate.png)

4. When you create a custom template, you see the **Device Details** page for your new device template. IoT Central automatically creates a simulated device when you create a device template. A simulated device lets you test the behavior of your application before you connect a real device.

The following sections describe each of the tabs on the **Device Template** page.

## Measurements

Measurements are the data that comes from your device. You can add multiple measurements to your device template to match the capabilities of your device.

- **Telemetry** measurements are the numerical data points that your device collects over time. They're represented as a continuous stream. An example is temperature.
- **Event** measurements are point-in-time data that represents something of significance on the device. A severity level represents the importance of an event. An example is a fan motor error.
- **State** measurements represent the state of the device or its components over a period of time. For example, a fan mode can be defined as having **Operating** and **Stopped** as the two possible states.

### Create a telemetry measurement

To add a new telemetry measurement, select **+ New Measurement**, choose **Telemetry** as the measurement type, and enter the details on the form.

> The field names in the device template must match the property names in the corresponding device code in order for the telemetry measurement to be displayed in the application when a real device is connected. Do the same when you configure settings, device properties, and commands as you continue to define the device template in the following sections.

For example, you can add a new temperature telemetry measurement:

| Display Name        | Field Name    |  Units    | Min   |Max|
| --------------------| ------------- |-----------|-------|---|
| Temperature         | temp          |  degC     |  0    |100|

!["Create Telemetry" form with details for temperature measurement](/media/howto-set-up-template/measurementsform.png)

After you select **Save**, the **Temperature** measurement appears in the list of measurements. In a short while, you see the visualization of the temperature data from the simulated device.

When displaying telemetry, you can choose from the following aggregation options: Average, Minimum, Maximum, Sum, and Count. **Average** is selected as the default aggregation on the chart.

> The data type of the telemetry measurement is a floating point number.

### Create an event measurement

To add a new event measurement, select **+ New Measurement** and select **Event** as the measurement type. Enter the details on the **Create Event** form.

Provide the **Display Name**, **Field Name**, and **Severity** details for the event. You can choose from the three available levels of severity: **Error**, **Warning**, and **Information**.

For example, you can add a new **Fan Motor Error** event.

| Display Name        | Field Name    |  Default Severity |
| --------------------| ------------- |-----------|
| Fan Motor Error     | fanmotorerror |  Error    |

!["Create Event" form with details for a fan motor event](/media/howto-set-up-template/eventmeasurementsform.png)

After you select **Save**, the **Fan Motor Error** measurement appears in the list of measurements. In a short while, you see the visualization of the event data from the simulated device.

To view more details about an event, select the event icon on the chart:

![Details for the "Fan Motor Error" event](/media/howto-set-up-template/eventmeasurementsdetail.png)

> The data type of the event measurement is string.

### Create a state measurement

To add a new state measurement, select the **+ New Measurement** button and select **State** as the measurement type. Enter the details on the **Create State** form.

Provide the details for **Display Name**, **Field Name**, and **Values** of the state. Each value can also have a display name that will be used when the value appears in charts and tables.

For example, you can add a new **Fan Mode** state that has two possible values that the device can send, **Operating** and **Stopped**.

| Display Name | Field Name    |  Value 1   | Display Name | Value 2    |Display Name  | 
| -------------| ------------- |----------- | -------------| -----------| -------------|
| Fan Mode     | fanmode       |  1         | Operating    |     0      | Stopped      |

!["Edit State" form with details for fan mode](/media/howto-set-up-template/statemeasurementsform.png)

After you select **Save**, the **Fan Mode** state measurement appears in the list of measurements. In a short while, you see the visualization of the state data from the simulated device.

If the device sends too many data points in a small duration, the state measurement appears with a different visual. Select the chart to view all the data points within that time period in chronological order. You can also narrow down the time range to see the measurement plotted on the chart.

> The data type of the state measurement is string.

## Settings

Settings control a device. They enable operators to provide inputs to the device. You can add multiple settings to your device template that appear as tiles on the **Settings** tab for operators to use. You can add many types of settings: number, text, date, toggle, pick list, and section label.

Settings can be in one of three states. The device reports these states.

- **Synced**: The device has changed to reflect the setting value.

- **Pending**: The device is currently changing to the setting value.

- **Error**: The device has returned an error.

For example, you can add a new fan speed setting by selecting **Settings** and entering in the new **Number** setting:

| Display Name  | Field Name    |  Units  | Decimals |Initial|
| --------------| ------------- |---------| ---------|---- |
| Fan Speed     | fanSpeed      | RPM     | 2        | 0   |

!["Configure Number" form with details for speed settings](/media/howto-set-up-template/settingsform.png)

After you select **Save**, the **Fan Speed** setting appears as a tile. An operator can use the setting on the **Devices** page to change the fan speed of the device.

## Properties

Properties are metadata that's associated with the device, such as device location and serial number. Add multiple properties to your device template that appear as tiles on the **Properties** tab. A property can have a type such as number, text, date, toggle, device property, label, or location. An operator can specify the values for properties when they create a device, and they can edit these values at any time. Device properties are read-only and are sent from the device to the application. An operator cannot change device properties. When a real device connects, the device property tile is updates in the application.

There are two categories of properties:

- _Device properties_ that the device reports to the IoT Central application. Device properties are read-only values reported by the device and are updated in the application when a real device is connected.
- _Application properties_ that are stored in the application and can be edited by the operator. The device doesn't recognize application properties.

For example, you can add the last serviced date for the device as a new **Date** property (an application property) on the **Properties** tab:

| Display Name  | Field Name | Initial Value   |
| --------------| -----------|-----------------|

!["Configure Last Serviced" form on the "Properties" tab](/media/howto-set-up-template/propertiesform.png)

After you select **Save**, the last serviced date for the device appears as a tile.

After you create the tile, you can change the application property value in the **Devices**.

### Create a location property through Azure Maps

You can give geographic context to your location data in Azure IoT Central and map any latitude and longitude coordinates of a street address. Or you can map latitude and longitude coordinates. Azure Maps enables this capability in IoT Central.

You can add two types of location properties:

- **Location as an application property**, which is stored in the application. The device doesn't recognize application properties.
- **Location as a device property**, which the device reports to the application.

#### Add location as an application property

![](/media/azure-maps.png)

You can create a location property as an application property by using Azure Maps in your IoT Central application. For example, you can add the device installation address:

1. Navigate to the **Properties** tab.

2. In the library, select **Location**.

3. Configure **Display Name**, **Field Name**, and (optionally) **Initial Value** for the location.

    | Display Name  | Field Name | Initial Value |
    | --------------| -----------|---------| 
    | Installation address | installAddress | Microsoft, 1 Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052   |

   !["Configure Location" form with details for location](/media/howto-set-up-template/locationcloudproperty2.png)

   There are two supported formats to add a location:
   - **Location as an address**
   - **Location as coordinates**

4. Select **Save**. An operator can update the location value in the **Devices**.

#### Add location as a device property

You can create a location property as a device property that the device reports. For example, if you want to track the device location:

1. Navigate to the **Properties** tab.

2. Select **Device Property** from the library.

3. Configure the display name and field name, and select **Location** as the data type:

    | Display Name  | Field Name | Data Type |
    | --------------| -----------|-----------|
    | Device location | deviceLocation | location  |

   > The field names must match the property names in the corresponding device code

   !["Configure Device Properties" form with details for location](/media/howto-set-up-template/locationdeviceproperty2.png)

Once the real device is connected, the location that you added as a device property is updated with the value sent by the device. Now that you've configured your location property, you can [add a map to visualize the location in the device dashboard](#add-an-azure-maps-location-in-the-dashboard).

## Commands

Commands are used to remotely manage a device. They enable operators to run commands on the device. You can add multiple commands to your device template that appear as tiles on the **Commands** tab for operators to use. As the builder of the device, you have the flexibility to define commands according to your requirements.

How is a command different from a setting?

* **Setting**: A setting is a configuration that you want to apply to a device. You want the device to persist that configuration until you change it. For example, you want to set the temperature of your freezer, and you want that setting even when the freezer restarts.

* **Command**: You use commands to instantly run a command on the device remotely from IoT Central. If a device isn't connected, the command times out and fails. For example, you want to restart a device.

For example, you can add a new **Echo** command by selecting the **Commands** tab, then selecting **+ New Command**, and entering the new command details:

| Display Name  | Field Name | Default Timeout | Data Type |
| --------------| -----------|---------------- | --------- |
| Echo Command  | echo       |  30             | text      |

!["Configure Command" form with details for echo](/media/howto-set-up-template/commandsecho.png)

After you select **Save**, the **Echo** command appears as a tile and is ready to be used from the **Devices** when your real device connects. The field names of your command must match the property names in the corresponding device code in order for commands to be run successfully.

## Rules

Rules enable operators to monitor devices in near real time. Rules automatically invoke actions such as sending an email when the rule is triggered. One type of rule is available today:

- **Telemetry rule**, which is triggered when the selected device telemetry crosses a specified threshold. [Learn more about telemetry rules](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-central/howto-create-telemetry-rules?WT.mc_id=iot-0000-dglover).

## Dashboard

The dashboard is where an operator can go to see information about a device. As a builder, you can add tiles on this page to help operators understand how the device is behaving. You can add multiple dashboard tiles to your device template. You can add many types of dashboard tiles such as image, line chart, bar chart, key performance indicator (KPI), settings and properties, and label.

For example, you can add a **Settings and Properties** tile to show a selection of the current values of settings and properties by selecting the **Dashboard** tab and the tile from the Library:

!["Configure Device Details" form with details for settings and properties](/media/howto-set-up-template/dashboardsettingsandpropertiesform.png)

Now when an operator views the dashboard in the **Devices**, they can see the tile.

### Add an Azure Maps location in the dashboard

If you configured a location property, you can visualize the location by using a map in your device dashboard.

1. Navigate to the **Dashboard** tab.

1. On the device dashboard, select **Map** from the library.

1. Give the map a title. The following example has the title **Installation Location**. Then choose the location property that you previously configured on the **Properties** tab. In the following example, **Installation address** is selected.

   !["Configure Map" form with details for title and properties](/media/howto-set-up-template/locationcloudproperty5map.png)

1. Select **Save**. The map tile now displays the location that you selected.

You can resize the map to your desired size. Now when an operator views the dashboard in the **Devices**, all the dashboard tiles that you've configured, including a location map are visible.
